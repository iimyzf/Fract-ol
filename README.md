  <strong>fract-ol</strong>
</h1>

## ðŸ’¡ About the project

> This project is pretty straight forward. You will code or create a basic computer graphics project, using the <strong>MiniLibX</strong>.
  You will mainly learn how to use the mathematical notion of complex numbers!

<br></br>

## ðŸŽ¬ Rendering

> - You must use the MiniLibX.
> - Your program must offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
> - The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the
computer).
> - You must be able to create different Julia sets by passing different parameters to
the program.
> - You must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal.

<br></br>

## ðŸŽ® Graphic management

> - Your program has to display the image in a window.
> - The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).
> - Pressing <strong>ESC</strong> or <strong>Clicking on the cross on the windowâ€™s frame</strong> must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
> - The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.
